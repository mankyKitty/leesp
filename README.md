Leesp!
=====

Wrote myself a Scheme in 48 hours, fancy that... (from the book of a remarkably similar name!).

Thanks to @bodil and @fogus for the inspiration to try my hand at building a Lisp, and thank you to Jonathan Tang and everyone that has contributed to the WikiBook in what ever capacity.

To try your own hand at this, head on over to [the book](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) and get cracking.

Binary for OSX is available on the Releases page.

Compiled using:```The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 7.6.3``` on OSX 10.8.

Other platforms should happily compile, but you'll have to manage that for yourselves (as I'm too lazy for VMs/Docker/Vagrant right now). The following should build the executable in a cabal-dev environment to try to keep things nice and clean.

```
cabal-dev install
```
Complicated no?

I've used the mtl package for ```Control.Monad.Error```.

Once you have a happy binary, you can either use the REPL (YES IT HAS A REPL! Omg, you have no idea how exciting it was to build a language that has it's own REPL... seriously... no idea) _\*ahem\*_ by just running the binary thus:

```
./leesp
```

Or alternately you can pass strings directly in for evaluation, however this process is a little weird because you have to escape everything like a champ and it becomes insufferable very quickly when dealing with strings:

```
./leesp "(cons \"foo\" `(bar #\b))"
```

head, rest, and friends are there. As well as _cons_, _if_, _cond_,
_case_, a whole bunch of mathematical operations, comparison
functions, atoms, and a handful of string functions: _string-ref_,
_string-set!_, _string-length_.

You are also able to use the traditional Lisp comment styles of:
```
;; Inline Comments
#| and block comments ! |#
#|
even
multiline
comments :D
|#

;; No nesting support though. :(
```

### UPDATES

- 29/01/2014 WE HAVE COMMENTS!!! Woo! Added support for inline and
  block comments. No support for nested block comments yet, don't be greedy.
- 13/01/2014 Added project cabal file (finally, holy hell). Began support for comments, so far it's not going so well.
- 01/11/2013 ADDED A STANDARD LIBRARY! OMG!! This was incredibly exciting. Now it really feels like a Lisp! (There is even closure support and everything. o.O). After pulling the cord on the REPL just run the following ```(import "leebs/stdleeb.leesp")``` or ```(import "path/to/leeb/stdleeb.leesp")``` and you should have everything in the stdleeb!
- 01/11/2013 Added support for loading text files as source files and the following file functions:```open-input-file```, ```open-output-file```, ```close-input-port```, ```close-output-port```, ```read```, ```write```, ```read-contents```, ```read-all```.
- 01/11/2013 Added the ability to create and store functions using ```define``` and ```lambda```.
- 31/10/2013 Added persistent variables from scheme, namely: ```define``` and ```set!```.

## TODO

* Add concurrency and parallel processing primitives (__selfTodo__: read Hoare's CSP paper, Actor Model papers, learn more Erlang)
* MACROS! Yeah that's right.. I went there.
* add granular imports for leeb functionality (only, except)
* try to implement more leebrary support (include, import, require)
* add load process for REPL to include files (like stdleeb)
* make it emit compilable code (ooooooo!)
* clean up the core source
* ~~add support for comments. This is inexplicably annoying.~~
* ~~add standard library~~
